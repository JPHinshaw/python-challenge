# python-challenge
I used the module walkthrough videos to help me code this assignment.

I cannot figure out what part of my code is wrong on the PyPoll assignment.  My code has the "loser" popping up as the winner.  I tried to edit many times and nearly broke my code a couple times.  I plan on revisiting this assignment.
